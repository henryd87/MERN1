[Verse 1]
I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me, look at the length of my hair, and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn what I do after years of just hearing them talking?

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter
